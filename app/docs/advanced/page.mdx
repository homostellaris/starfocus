import Callout from '@/components/docs/Callout'

# Advanced Features

This page demonstrates how to use custom React components in your MDX documentation.

## Using Custom Components

You can import and use React components directly in MDX files. Here's an example using our custom `Callout` component:

<Callout type="info" title="Pro Tip">
  This is a custom React component embedded in MDX! You can pass props and use full React functionality.
</Callout>

## Different Callout Types

<Callout type="success" title="Success">
  This is a success message. Great for highlighting positive outcomes!
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Warning">
  This is a warning. Use it to draw attention to important caveats.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error" title="Error">
  This is an error message. Use it to highlight things to avoid.
</Callout>

## Code Examples

Here's how the Callout component is used:

```jsx
import Callout from '@/components/docs/Callout'

<Callout type="info" title="My Title">
  Your content here
</Callout>
```

## Creating Your Own Components

You can create any React component and use it in MDX:

1. Create a component in `/components/docs/`
2. Import it at the top of your MDX file
3. Use it like any JSX element

<Callout type="success" title="That's it!">
  You now know how to combine the power of React components with the simplicity of Markdown.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

- Create your own custom documentation components
- Style them with Tailwind CSS
- Use them across your docs
