# AI integration

We don't like AI features for the sake of it but Starfocus stores helpful context for your goals in the form of metadata and notes which makes it an excellent source of context for AI assistants that you use.

We'll aim to make it as seamless as possible for your AI of choice to pull in context from Starfocus when necessary and we see it possibly becoming the composer of tasks to continously feed into agents based on the priorities and order you've established.
