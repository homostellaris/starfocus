# Checkins

Starfocus encourages you to brain dump your goals as-is. You don't need to do the mental work of breaking down a goal, you can just add it and assign it the appropriate amount of star points.

The consequence of this is that some objectives will be long-lived and that's a good thing. But in reality you will work on an objective and then be done until the next day.

Checkins provide a way to record progress against a todo without fully 'completing' it.

These checkins will contribute to a 'pulse' graph which shows along the bottom of objectives.

There is also a 'checkin and snooze' action for todos which provides a convenient way to say you're done for the day with a certain task.
