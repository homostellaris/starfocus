# Sync

To sync your data you can hit the sync button in the top-right. This will prompt you for an email address.

We will then use a cloud service to securely sync your data to any other device. Simply go to Starfocus, hit sync
on the other device, enter the same email, then your data will appear.

<Callout
	type="warning"
	title="Warning"
>
	After syncing, the current data becomes associated with your email address.
	Unsyncing will clear all data on this device until you log in again.
</Callout>
