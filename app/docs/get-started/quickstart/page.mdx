# Getting started

Starfocus uses an in-browser database which means you can get started simply by visiting the [home](/home) page,
no signup required.

If you decide you would like to use Starfocus on other devices then you can choose to [sync](./sync) your data.

	One benefit of this model is that you can use Starfocus in a 'throw-away'
	fashion. You could open a new incognito tab, brain dump a bunch of competing
	priorities, and order them using Starfocus' tools. Then when you're done you
	can just close the tab and the data is gone.
