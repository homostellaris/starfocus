# Asteroid field

The asteroid field contains tasks which demand immediate attention.
They will try to feign urgency but are usually nothing more than distractions.
Delegate, defer, or delete where possible to accelerate though this treacherous region as fast as possible so you can
move on to the mission-critical objectives in your Wayfinder.
