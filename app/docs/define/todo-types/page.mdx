# Todo types

When you create a todo you have to give it a title.

You can also assign two optional pieces of metadata.

- [Star role](../../concepts/star-roles/page.mdx)
- [Star points](../../concepts/star-points/page.mdx)

A todo without only a title is assumed to be worth `0` star points and is therefore considered an _impediment_ which is sent to the asteroid field.

A todo with either `1` or more star points is considered an _objective_ and sent to the wayfinder.

You can also optionally send any type of todo to the database where it is considered an _idea_.
