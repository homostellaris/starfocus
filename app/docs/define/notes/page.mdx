# Notes

Inline with the "do one thing well" tenet of our [philosophy](../../concepts/philosophy) we do not want to become yet another place you store notes.

Note-taking is incredibly specific to individual preferences so we will aim to provide ways to integrate with your provider of choice.

Currently we only integrate with Obsidian but we will add more and make it possible to write your own adapters if you know basic scripting.
