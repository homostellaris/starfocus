# Markdown Export

Inline with the "do one thing well" tenet of our [philosophy](../../concepts/philosophy) we do not want to become yet another place you store notes.

Instead, Starfocus syncs your todos as markdown files with YAML front matter to a local directory on your device. Each file includes the todo's title, star points, star role, and other metadata.

Filenames are derived from the todo title plus a short ID, making them easy to find and reference.

You can use this to integrate with external tools like Obsidian, feed context to LLMs, or build your own workflows on top of the exported data. Auto-sync keeps the files up to date, or you can trigger a one-time export from settings.
