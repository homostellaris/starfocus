# Philosophy

# Specific to you

In this age of constant distraction and information overload we need
more thoughtfully designed apps that learn what is important to us and
help us to stay focused.

# Designed for humans

A key design goal of Starfocus is to embrace our imperfect human
nature. Rigid scheduling of todos is error-prone and demotivating.
Never-ending backlogs of todos are anxiety-inducing. We prefer
goal-setting, brain-dumping, and space exploration!

# Friendly to robots

The ultimate todo list is one that does the tasks for you.
Starfocus will always aim to integrate well with your favourite assistant to provide context about what is important to
you so they can be even more helpful.
