# Ordering

Todos within the asteroid field and the wayfinder can be ordered manually by you so that you have a clear plan going forward.

Todo ordering is absolute within a particular region meaning that it is maintained across star roles. If you move a particular todo above one from another star role whilst filtering and then change the filter it will honour that decision and always remain above it.
