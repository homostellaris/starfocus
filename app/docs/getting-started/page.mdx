# Getting Started

Welcome! Let's get you started with Starfocus.

## Installation

Starfocus is a web application that works in your browser. Simply visit [starfocus.app](https://starfocus.app) to get started.

### Mobile Apps

For the best mobile experience:

- **Android**: Download from Google Play
- **iOS**: Coming soon

## Your First Steps

### 1. Create Your First Star Role

Star Roles represent different areas of your life - work, personal projects, hobbies, etc.

```typescript
// Example: Defining a star role in code
const starRole = {
  name: "Software Engineer",
  color: "#4453a9",
  active: true
}
```

### 2. Add Your First Todo

Click the + button to add a todo. Don't worry about getting it perfect - you can always edit it later.

### 3. Explore Constellations

Group related todos into constellations to see the bigger picture.

## Key Concepts

### Brain Dumping

Starfocus encourages you to brain dump - just get your thoughts out without worrying about organization. You can organize later.

### Star Points

Star points help you prioritize what matters. Allocate points to your star roles based on what's important right now.

### Flexible Scheduling

Unlike traditional todo apps, Starfocus doesn't force you into rigid schedules. Work at your own pace.

## Pro Tips

- **Use keyboard shortcuts** for faster navigation
- **Brain dump regularly** to keep your mind clear
- **Review your constellations** weekly
- **Adjust star points** as your priorities change
