# Star roles

When thinking about what productivity means to you it makes sense to consider what your important roles are in life.

If you are a father then the next most important thing to do is likely to be something which will benefit your family.

If you are employed then you'll likely have ambitions there too.

Its difficult to prioritise across these domains and sometimes it doesn't make sense to try.

Star roles allow you to define these different roles, assign todos to them, and ultimately make better decisions about where to invest your efforts.

One way you can define star roles is to define a 'vision' for each role. This is a short story or description of what it would look like if you had fulfilled that role to the best of your potential.
