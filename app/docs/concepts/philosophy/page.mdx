# Philosophy

Starfocus is an evolving product so we think its important for you to understand our vision. Below we describe different tenets which will guide the design of Starfocus as we make it the best productivity tool in the universe.

# Specific to you

In this age of constant distraction and information overload we need
more thoughtfully designed apps that learn what is important to us and
help us to stay focused.

# Designed for humans

A key design goal of Starfocus is to embrace our imperfect human
nature. Rigid scheduling of todos is error-prone and demotivating.
Never-ending backlogs of todos are anxiety-inducing. We prefer
goal-setting, brain-dumping, and space exploration!

# Friendly to robots

The ultimate todo list is one that does the tasks for you.
Starfocus will always aim to integrate well with your favourite assistant to provide context about what is important to
you so they can be even more helpful.

# Do one thing well

This comes from the Unix philosophy. Starfocus is designed to help you define your definition of productivity and prioritise against it. We will not bloat the app with more and more features to try and reach new markets. It will do this one thing well, with style and polish.

# Gamification shouldn't be a gimmick

Gamification should be fun and functional. It shouldn't compromise the efficiency of the app in anyway. A productivity app that causes you to lose productivity due to playing a game would be pointless.
